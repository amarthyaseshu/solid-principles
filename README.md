Practicing solid principle concept

Why solid principles:

To make sure our changes dont impact others & others changes should mostly dont impact ours in future

S- Single Responsibility
O- Open Closed
L- Liskov Substitution
I- Interface Segregation
D- Dependency Inversion

S- Single Responsibility: One class should have only 1 responsibility

O- Open for extension Closed for modification

L- Derived type should be completely substitutable with Base type

I- Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they dont use, should split interfaces to smaller & more specific ones

D- Depend on abstractions, not on concretions - Autowiring
